Why am I publishing my writing online?
 
Here's what I thought when I made this decision, 

### 1. This is a great way to force me to build a "habit" of writing
It's pretty obvious. By writing online, especially on my own blog out of all things, I feel a weird *sense of anticipation* that there MUST be a NEW CONTENT by the end of the week.  

Where did this anticipation or sense of commitment come from? I have no idea, but I will research this weird phenomenon, that keeps the giant library of content, AKA the Internet, which is overflowing with bullshit opinions that people do care about.

### 2. To dwell deeper on my thoughts and for clarity
Recently, I came across a great article written by Paul Graham on "[Putting Ideas Into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)"  The take here is:
>you think you know a lot on a certain topic, that is until you have written it down. 

I'm pretty sure you had a similar experience before. Let's say, one day, you were asked about a topic that you were pretty confident on, for example, cooking. You were saying that "Yea, season before you cook it on the pan.", and the guy just keeps asking why, and you just can't explain or have a proper reason to refute. 

This happens, when you do not have a solid understanding of cooking. You are missing the foundations. Sure, you have a vague and basic understanding, but truthfully, it is never enough. 

By writing it down, you get an opportunity to sit down and talk to your brain, **find the missing gaps** in knowledge, and **fix loopholes** that contradict your opinions. 


### 3. To take accountability for my thoughts
Many times, I happened to find myself in a situation where my perception of a certain issue was "false". So, what happens next when someone successfully persuades me to accept their point of view on that issue? I sweep my previous stand under the rug, and accept the new idea as a whole. 

I hate this idea of just abandoning your previous stand as if it were heresy, and I hate that I take no accountability for my aggressive stance that attacks opposition in the ideal of "I'm right, you're wrong".

In my opinion, there is no such thing as a false truth. Instead, **all ideas are built on multiple perspectives*, and that inconsideration to take in other points of view is causing a "witch hunt" in the modern society, where only majority only considers the socially acceptable concept, and deema all others "false". 

However, taking accountability for what you said and thought is important to learn from it. That is because you might discover something new by recording it down. You will dig deeper on your perspectives before, and end up with more clarity on the issue than ever, Then, integration of your own perspectives with others perspectives happens better and more efficiently than before, *creating a more **complete understanding** of the issue*.

<div class="dropcaps2"> All in all, </div>
the ultimate aim is to *create a **better version of myself** through writing*. With all that said, do understand that my views on certain issues are not meant to offend anyone, it is to document and understand myself better, that's all.
