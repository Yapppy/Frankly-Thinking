When I am attending a presentation by my peers, one question always lingers in my mind without fail.

"How can a presentation that is *obviously*, carefully planned and prepared with sufficient time, be that **BAD**......?"

Most people will just conclude that the presentation is bad, because the speakers are just bad at presenting. Well, learning how to present properly is one thing; however, one can easily up their game by just being brief.

Being brief, means talking less; but in this context, it means giving less information and details. 

Have you ever felt that a presentation is distracting, confusing, and boring?

Those feelings of yours are valid, it is not you, it is the presentations.

A detailed presentation is unnecessary. First and foremost, a presentation is not a report; it is meant to inform your audiences on what they need to hear and know about. 

Well, some might argue that a presentation needs depth! In reality, it needs less "talking".

According to a book that I have just read, "Brief" by Joseph McCormack. Plenty of evidence is stated on the need to be brief to drive out confusion and the waste of time, effort, and resources.

##### Reasons To Be Brief
###### People are inattention (short attention span)
Younger generations have an especially short attention span. This short attention span causes the audiences to be unable to focus on the presentations. So, when you are off talking about the tiniest details of your subject. Your audience's mind is already somewhere else.

###### People have interruptions
Phones and social media are distracting. It is attracting your audiences by being more attractive. Learn from your opponent, and make your presentations ass attractive as Tiktok. How? Just give them small bites of information that is easy to consume and to process. 

###### People are impatience
How long does it take you to go over your slides? 
If it's more than 2 minute, scrap it off. People feel frustrated when you take a significant amount of time (yes, 2 minutes is a lot in a presentation), just to summarize a slide; even worse, they have already finish "glancing" off the slides and are waiting for you to finish. 

###### People have Information Inundation
In this world of information overflow, people are drowning in a pool of words, images, sounds and social media. Our mental capacity to handle and manage all these information are overloaded; so, do us a favor, get your points though quick and brief.

Now that we have understand the NEED to be brief, we also need to learn HOW & WHERE to be brief. 

1. Throw away buzzwords and jargon
   Stop pretending to be sophisticated by masking your message with meaningless and fancy words that only confuse and distract people. You should change your dictionary, depending on the crowd of audiences you have. For example, if you are presenting an issue to people in your industry or line of work, technical words are perfectly fine. However, if you are presenting to a crowd of strangers, use simple visuals and storytelling to illustrate.
2. Simplify, simplify, simplify
   Most of the time, the whole point of having presentation is to summarize and to demonstrate your understanding of a topic. Well, this means filtering your content. It is unnecessary to remind your audiences on something that they are knowledgeable on in lengthy ways. And it is unnecessary to include details that is not relevant on your slides, it only distracts and confuses them.
3. Make it Relevant
   Understand your audiences, on what they need and want to hear from your presentations. Tell them WHY they need to understand this important concept, and how it IMPACTS their lives. Make your topic and your content THEIR CONCERN. By connecting your presentations with your audiences on a deep personal level, your audience becomes more interested and eager to consume.
4. Have a CONVERSATION
   Present, like you are talking to your audiences. Rather than a presentation, people much prefer a conversation instead. Your audience, takes an more active role in your presentations by opting for active listening and positive feedback that lasts. Hence, positive loop of information exchange is established. 
5. Visuals and Infographic
   We are in an era where people consume visuals better than words. So, use visuals for better comprehension and understanding of the impact, and retain the attention of your audiences by substituting lengthy explanations with the more effective alternatives -- Visuals. Other than the conventional visuals like images and videos, you can format your slides. This means formatting your slides, so that, it's easier to view and understand. For example, bolding key points and assigning sub topics appropriately.  
6. Tell a Story
   Storytelling is one of the most oldest and successful methods of getting your points through; and, everyone knows that the most successful brands builds their wealth through great storytelling. Your audiences wants to know about you; so, feed them your personal experiences and your stand on any issues. This, creates an attractive bait to lure in your audiences and have create a lasting impression. 
7. PLAN IT
   Remember those days when Miss ABC asked you to write down your ideas and elaborate before you start writing? YES, we need to PLAN your presentations. 
   The impact of outlining and mind mapping your content is significant. You avoid wasting time and resources, both yours and your audiences. It helps to identify a direct and clear key point, while also reorganizing your thoughts into categories. Hence, having a well organized presentations in general.

All of the above can be applied into different scenarios not just presentations alone. There is more to being brief than what I have listed. 


I strongly recommend the book Brief, by Joseph McCormack, where I have gotten all the points, to understand being brief in different context, such as daily messages, meetings and briefings, and strategic communications. Additionally, more details on how to outline and mind map for different context are also given.
