Creating a blog is not easy, especially when I decided not to use some other easier alternatives like Wordpress or Wix.

With almost zero knowledge in coding and using github itself, I underestimated the time and effort needed to set up the foundations for this website. While it only took me 2 days to understand Jekyyl, a week was taken to just figure out how to configure the basic settings of this template used for the blog from chesterhow/tale. 


<p> Well, here I am writing a post after days of creating it. Hoping to start my day fresh, by finishing my first post on my very first blog. </p>
