When I am attending a presentation by my peers, one question always lingers in my mind without fail.

>"How can a presentation that is *obviously*, carefully planned and prepared with sufficient time, be that **BAD**......?"

Most people... will just conclude that the presentation is bad, because the speakers are just bad. Well... learning how to present properly is one thing; however, one can easily up their game by just being brief.

<div class="dropcaps2"> Being brief, means talking less; </div> In this context, it means **planning** your communication by **filtering** out information according to 
the **needs & wants** of your audiences.

>Have you ever felt that a presentation is distracting, confusing, and boring?

Those feelings of yours are valid, it is not you, it is the them. It is them being not brief.

### A detailed presentation is unnecessary

First and foremost, a presentation is not a report; it is meant to *inform* or to *entertain* your audiences, on what they need and want to hear. It is a balance of informative and entertainment.

Well, some might argue that a presentation needs depth! In reality, it needs less "talking".

<div class="dropcaps"> According </div> to a book that I have just read, "Brief" by Joseph McCormack. Plenty of evidence is stated on the reasons to be brief to drive out confusion and the waste of time, effort, and resources. 

#####  People are inattention (short attention span)
Younger generations have an especially short attention span. This short attention span causes the audiences to be unable to focus on the presentations. So, when you are off talking about the tiniest details of your subject. Your audience's mind is already somewhere else.

##### People have interruptions
Phones and social media are distracting. It is attracting your audiences by being more attractive. Learn from your opponent, and make your presentations ass attractive as Tiktok. How? Just give them small bites of information that is easy to consume and to process. 

##### People are impatience
How long does it take you to go over your slides? 
If it's more than 2 minute, scrap it off. People feel frustrated when you take a significant amount of time (yes, 2 minutes is a lot in a presentation), just to summarize a slide; even worse, they have already finish "glancing" off the slides and are waiting for you to finish. 

##### People have Information Inundation
In this world of information overflow, people are drowning in a pool of words, images, sounds and social media. Our mental capacity to handle and manage all these information are overloaded; so, do us a favor, get your points though quick and brief.


<br>
Since, we have understand the NEED to be brief, we also need to learn **HOW** & **WHERE** to be brief. 

##### <u> Throw away buzzwords and jargon </u>
Stop pretending to be sophisticated by masking your message with meaningless and fancy words that only confuse and distract people. You should **change your dictionary**, depending on the crowd of audiences. For example, if you are presenting an issue to people in your industry or line of work, technical words are perfectly fine. However, if you are presenting to a crowd of strangers, use simple visuals and storytelling to illustrate.


##### <u> Simplify, simplify, simplify </u>
Most of the time, the whole point of having presentation is to summarize and to demonstrate your understanding of a topic. Well, this means **filtering** your content. It is *unnecessary to remind* your audiences on something that they are knowledgeable on in lengthy ways. And it is *unnecessary to include details that is not relevant* on your slides, it only distracts and confuses them.


##### <u> Make it Relevant </u>
Understand your audiences, on *what they need and want to hear* from your presentations. Tell them **WHY** they need to understand this important concept, and how it **IMPACTS** their lives. Make your topic and your content **THEIR CONCERN**. By connecting your presentations with your audiences on a deep personal level, your audience becomes more interested and eager to consume.

##### <u> Have a CONVERSATION </u>
Present, like you are talking to your audiences. Rather than a presentation, people much prefer a conversation instead. Your audience, takes an more *active role* in your presentations by opting for active listening and *positive feedback* that lasts. Hence, positive loop of information exchange is established. 

##### <u> Visuals and Infographic </u>
We are in an era where people consume visuals better than words. So, use visuals for *better comprehension and understanding* of the impact, and *retaining attention* of your audiences by substituting lengthy explanations with the more effective alternatives -- Visuals. Other than the conventional visuals like images and videos, you can format your slides. This means **formatting** your slides, so that, it's easier to view and understand. For example, *bolding* key points and assigning *sub topics* appropriately.  

##### <u> Tell a Story </u>
Storytelling is one of the most oldest and successful methods of getting your points through; and, everyone knows that the most successful brands builds their wealth through great storytelling. Your audiences wants to know about you; so, feed them your personal experiences and your stand on any issues. This, creates an attractive *bait* to lure in your audiences and have *create a lasting impression*. 

##### <u> PLAN IT </u>
Remember those days when Miss asked you to write down your ideas and elaborate before you start writing? YES, we need to PLAN your presentations. 
The impact of **outlining** and **mind mapping** your content is significant. You avoid wasting time and resources, both yours and your audiences. It helps to identify a *direct and clear key point*, while also reorganizing your thoughts into categories. Hence, having a well organized presentations in general.

### Side Note

All of the above can be applied into different scenarios not just presentations alone. There is more to being brief than what I have listed. 


I strongly recommend the book **《 Brief 》"**, by **Joseph McCormack**, if you want to know how to apply the "being brief" strategy in *work situations*. The author writes about being brief in different context, such as daily messages, meetings and briefings, and *strategic communications*. Additionally, more details on how to outline and mind map for different context are also given.
