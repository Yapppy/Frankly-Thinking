<summary> How character ethics and personality ethics fit into our principle-centered paradigm, that rules over our behavior and attitude, in which an understanding of it would lead to our personal success.</summary>
<!--more-->

<br>

First , let's understand character ethic and personality ethic from their fundamentals. 

Character ethic is the inner core value of us, our principles as individuals and the traits that make up a person, such as integrity, humility, hard work, loyalty, self-control, courage, justice, patience, modesty, and morality.

On the other hand, personality ethic is the combination of elements that make up how we appear to others, whereby skills and techniques are practice to refine our outer image according to societal standards.

## The Shift from Character Ethic to Personality Ethic
---

<br>
In the past, literature focused on character ethics as the foundation of success. 

However, World War 1 has change our perception and idea of success to personality ethic where the external appearance are emphasized by practicing skills and techniques, in which success are determined on the personality, public image, attitudes & behaviours, skills & techniques. Personality ethics took on two main paths:
1. Human & Public Relation Techniques
2. Positive Mental Attitudes (PMA)

So, people started to treat problems with manipulations that only treats the surface rather than the deep rooted cause of the problem. Quick-fixes, power strategies, communication skills, and positive attitudes are the main ideas of personality ethics based books.


Here's what I have concluded about Character Ethic and Personality Ethic...



### Character Ethic 
   1. **Shifting our Perceptions** according to another person's values and identity.
   2. **Primary Traits** that determines your success / Foundation
   "Humans are so focused on our buildings that we have forgotten the foundation that holds it up."
   3. Long-Run / Builds the Foundation
   4. Internal
   5. Effects are magnified with personality ethics based techniques

>"What we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do."

<br>

### Personality Ethic
1. **Shifting & Changing Others** according to our image/ Shifting & Changing Yourself to society standards
2. **Secondary Traits** / Building
3. External
4. Works Best at Short-Term / Shortcut
5. Viewed as manipulative, if its own character is flawed.

## What is Paradigm?
---

<br>
Paradigm is a model, theory. perception, assumption, or frame of reference. It is the **way we see** the world, in terms of perceiving, understanding and interpreting.
This means that paradigm is the *source of our behaviour and attitudes*.

To understand paradigm, simply think of it as a map; it is not a territory but an interpretation of a territory based on our perceptions. 
There are two types of maps:
- maps of things are: Realities
- maps of things should be: Values

We simply assume this is the way that things are, and the way they should be. However, our perceptions/paradigm are heavily conditioned. 

Everyone has a different lens on seeing the world, and it is conditioned differently; however. that does not mean there is not facts, there is an identical facts in everything, the common ground in what we see. 

In short, **seeing is being**. The way we see the world is highly interrelated to what we are.

<br>
>What can we do with our paradigm, our perceptions and assumptions?

1. Be aware of our Paradigms & the effect of Conditioning 
    - Understand our Perceptions & Assumptions on Realities & Values;
    - Understand the extend of Social Conditioning on our Paradigms;
2. Test them against reality
    - Listen to others & Be Open to their Perceptions
==> To get a larger picture ==> more Objective View (Paradigm Shift)

<br>

### Paradigm Shift
>Every significant break through in the field of scientific endeavour is first, a break with tradition, with the old ways of thinking, with old paradigms.

Paradigm shift can be:
- Positive/Negative
- Instantaneous/Developmental

If you desire a minor change, focus on our attitudes and behaviors; 
If you desire a quantum and significant change, focus on the source of our attitudes and behaviours, the way we see things, our paradigm, the root. 

<br>
### Principle-Centered Paradigm
Paradigm are built on principles, and those principles of human effectiveness are the **natural laws** that cannot be broken or altered.

What is principles?
Principles are the **fundamental truth** that things are built on. There are not situational like practices, because practices that works in one circumstance will not necessarily work in another.

- Principles are not values. Principles are the territory, values are the map 
- Principles are guidelines that are unarguable.

>Why are principles important to our paradigm?

The more closely our paradigm are aligned with the principles/natural laws, the more accurate and functional our paradigm will be. Correct maps will impact our effectiveness far more than any amount of effort to change our attitudes and behaviours.

#### Principle of Growth & Change
There are *sequential stages of growth and change that cannot be skipped*. 
Personality ethic is the opposite; it appeals on the sense of a quick and easy way to skip the painful process of change, to achieve results that are often short and illusionary.

It's easier to relate and materialized the principle of growth and change on physical manifestation, like a baby to a crawling toddler, whereas emotional areas like human relationships and personal development are hard and difficult.

Personality ethic, on the other hand, thrives, due to people who do not comprehend the principle of growth and change, where there are no shortcuts to improving.

### Inside-Out

The significant problem we face cannot be solve at the same level of thinking when we were at when we created them. 

A new and deeper level of thinking is required to:
- solve problem by understanding the fundamental of the deep rooted cause
- recognize & develop principles deep inside the conscious, to develop habits

### The Maturity Continuum

The seven habits moves the users on a maturity continuum from dependence, independence, to interdependence. 
- ***Dependence***: *you* take care of me, you help me think
- ***Independence***: *I* can do it, I can think for myself
- ***Interdependence***: 
    - *we* can do it, we can cooperate, we can combine our talents and abilities to create something greater together



### P/PC Balanced = True Effectiveness
P = Production of desired Result -- Golden Egg
PC = Production Capability (ability/asset used to produce) -- Goose

If focused on getting the maximized production of golden egg, the goose will be overused and broken down; 

If focused on caring for the welfare of the goose, the production of the golden egg is under production causing the owner to unable to feed for himself;

In conclusion, true effectiveness comes when the P (Production) & PC (Production Capability) are balanced.
