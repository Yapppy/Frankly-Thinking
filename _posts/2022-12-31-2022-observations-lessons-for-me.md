<summary> 2022 is a big year for me, because I am finally able to take back control of my life. </summary> <!--more-->

University life is something my parents never had, and as the first born of the family, I will be the first university graduate in the family book. 

Like every newcomers, I was also eager and motivated to do great things in my university life. Well, "great things" as in making friends, joining clubs, and improving myself mentally and spiritually. 

<div class="dropcaps"> HOWEVER </div>
*even until the ending of my first semester, I was left with only disatisfaction, as I felt that everything could have been better ---* 
>Friends? Not really, more like classmates and groupmates. <br>
>Clubs? Joined two, but there's not much going on. <br>
>Improving myself? Could have done better. <br>

<br>
With the bitter taste that is left, I took some time and figured things out. <br>
>**"Why am I dissatisfied?"** <br>
>**"What's the lesson here?"** <br>
>**"How can I do better?"** <br>

And thus, here I am listing out all the observations and lessons I have learned. 

<br>

## Not Everyone Wants To Be Friends
Some people are just not here to make friends. Unfortunately, I couldn't understand such a simple lesson even after years. 

In a school environment, they're two kinds of people, a “friend” and a “classmate”. In a work environment, it is a “friend” and a “colleague”. The difference is big but I have always mixed it two together.  

To avoid waste effort and putting false expectation of what a friend should do on a classmate, it is important to identify their **intentions and priorities**.

Behaviors and attitudes of a classmate
- Most communications happen for **task purposes** or for a **common goal**, like assignments and projects.
- Lack of genuine interest
- Conversations are there to fill the *silence*

## Missed Opportunities
>We cannot lead a choiceless life. Every day, every moment, and every second, there is a choice. If it were not so, we would not be individuals. --- “Ernest Holmes”

Opportunities come in many forms, for me, it were events and lectures. Outside of classroom opportunities are the best because there is freedom to pick whichever topic that interest you, while the contents are also up-to-date.  

Even so, I have declined all these opportunities for various reasons. 

First, the closest people to me in the campus are often not interested at all. However, referring back to the previous lessons, I have learned that they are not my friends. 

Mainly, I was *afraid of making mistakes* and being embarrassed. Due to my lack of experience in many aspects of life, I am always scared of showing my incompetence to others. After all the opportunities I had to pass on, I finally worked up the courage to go for it. In the end, I have successfully become a committee member of a club. 

So, how did I overcome this fear of mine? 
<br>

**Most people care more about themselves than others.** So, why should you be afraid of making a mistake, when they will soon forget about it when other matters of importance show up?

When I learned about this truth, I still could not bear to take those opportunities. However, it took some time to convince myself by observing. One time, I gave a bad presentation. For me, it was a mistake that was so huge that it would impact my image. In spite of that, I noticed that my classmates were so busy caring about their own presentations that they overlooked and quickly forgot about my mistake. And this is what it took to convince me.

## Different Priorities In life
>Everyone has different priorities. So, never assume and have expectation. 

For me, I have learned not to assume that people will finish the task. Instead, relying on myself and preparing a backup plan are the better choice.

Well, here's the argument.
“Should I handle it all by myself? or should I delegate it to others?”
If I take all the responsibility myself, it will be unfair to me and the others. But handing out tasks means getting a lower quality work because the other party neither wants to work nor communicate. 

I have no counter for this as of current, but by understanding that everyone's priorities are different from mine, I am able to approach this problem with *empathy and sympathy* for myself and others. Knowing that my attitude or my personality did not inflict these issues, it is only a matter of different priorities in life.

## Don't Complain, Don't Criticize, Don't Condemn
Here's something that is difficult for me to learn.

>No one wants to hear you complain; it's not all about you.

I often found myself complaining of a person's behavior, while fully knowing that it would make me look bad. From young, I have known that these habits of mine have deep consequence. Damaged relationships is what affects me the most, and having no friends to begin with just sprinkles more salt on the wound. 

>People often assume that everyone is similar and the same as them. So, if someone does not meet their standard of societal acceptance is, they complain.

From what I have observed, complaining is a **reflection** of myself. 

For me, I noticed that my complaints are often built on the jealousy that someone gets to do something that I can't. For example, I typically condemn excessive spending behavior, because I do not have the luxury to afford a cup of Starbucks coffee every morning, and a Boba milk tea for every lunch.

All in all, I hate this side of me that ruins so many things in my life. Now that I understand the cause of this behavior,

I am able to avoid displaying this behavior. To reduce my urge to complain, criticize and condemn, I practice **gratitude journaling**. 

Journaling, for me, is a way to complain, and to look into my jealousy and dissatisfaction by writing it down in details. Thus, I can understand where I'm coming from. Gratitude helps me to accept the reality, and the fact that nothing can change from complaining.
